During freshman spring I had a bit of extra time and so decided to have a go at competitive programming. 
This is a collection of problems I've solved, ranging from trivial CodeForce Div2A problems to challenging problems at the IOI. By the end of summer, I hope to be able to solve at least 
some ICPC problems as well within the time frame given.
